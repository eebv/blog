Dear Staff,

Greetings! I am an educator, and I would like to solemnly state that I have never created multiple Gmail accounts using any improper means. In my teaching, I introduced the advantages of the Google platform to students and invited them to experience registering their own Google accounts on my device. As you may understand, these students are still young and do not have smart devices of their own, so they cannot register accounts independently. This is why multiple accounts were registered on the same device.

Currently, one studentâ€™s account has been suspended, and she is truly heartbroken. Considering that this situation arose from special educational needs rather than malicious violations, I earnestly request you to review the account status and unblock it. If any supplementary materials or explanations are needed, I will fully cooperate. Thank you for your understanding and support!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
